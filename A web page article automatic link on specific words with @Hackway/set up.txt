## To automatically link specific words in a web page article with the given @Hackway code, you can follow these steps:

This code is an HTML page that includes JavaScript and CSS. It features a paragraph of text with a disclaimer and a centered image. The CSS code styles the links in the text, giving them a blue color, removing the underline, and adding a bottom border that transitions to a different color on hover. The JavaScript code automatically converts specific words in the paragraphs into clickable links, using an object to define the words and their corresponding URLs. The code loops through each paragraph, splits the words, checks if a word matches one in the object, and replaces it with a link if there's a match.

1) Create a new HTML file or open an existing one where you want to implement the automatic linking of words.
2) Place the CSS code provided inside <style> tags in the <head> section of your HTML file. This code styles the links and adds a hover effect.
3) Place the JavaScript code provided inside <script> tags in the <head> or <body> section of your HTML file. This code defines the words to be linked and loops through the paragraphs to replace those words with appropriate links.
4) Save the HTML file.

## The final HTML file structure should look like this:

###The code

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <style>
    a {
      color: blue;
      text-decoration: none;
      border-bottom: 2px solid #0077c0;
      transition: border-bottom-color 0.2s;
    }

    a:hover {
      color: green;
      border-bottom-color: #94c6e5;
    }
  </style>
</head>
